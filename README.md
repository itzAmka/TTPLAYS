# TTPLAYS - A starter project for TTPLAYS Stack

## What is TTPLAYS?

TTPLAYS stands for TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Prisma, Lucia Auth, Your Database, and Superforms. It is a Sveltekit-Stack that uses these technologies to create a full-stack web application.

## What is included?

- T - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- T - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- P - [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - A database toolkit for Typescript and Node.js.
- LA - [Lucia Auth](https://lucia-auth.com/) - Lucia is an auth library for TypeScript that abstracts away the complexity of handling users and sessions. It works alongside your database to provide an API that's easy to use, understand, and extend.
- Y - [Your Database](https://lucia-auth.com/basics/database) - A database of your choice.
- S - [Superforms](https://superforms.rocks/) - Superforms is a SvelteKit library that gives you a comprehensive solution for server and client validation, and client-side display of forms.
